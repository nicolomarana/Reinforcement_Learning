# Reinforcement Learning
This Repository contain my personal overview of the most important arguments of Reinforcement Learning.

The arguments are:

- Markov Decision Process (MDP)
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Monte-Carlo Learning (MC)
- Temporal Difference Learning (TD) [Sarsa & Q-Learning]
- Deep Q-Learning (DQL-DQN)

----------------------------------
I create this repository studying books, follow online MOOC, and search information on the Web, in the folder "References" there are the most important resources that I've used.
